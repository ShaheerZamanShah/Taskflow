1. Upload code to GitHub (use `upload-to-github.bat` helper)
2. Connect Vercel to GitHub for frontend
3. Connect Railway to GitHub for backend
4. Automatic deployments on code changes

## 📁 Files Ready for Deployment:

### Frontend (Production Build)
- Location: `frontend/build/` folder
- Ready to upload to: Netlify, Vercel, or any static hosting

### Backend (Node.js App)

### Option 2: GitHub First (Recommended)
1. Run `upload-to-github.bat` and follow instructions
2. Connect both platforms to your GitHub repo
3. Set environment variables
4. Enjoy automatic deployments!

## 📞 After Deployment Test These URLs:
- **Landing Page**: `https://your-app.netlify.app` (should show TaskFlow landing)
- **Health Check**: `https://your-backend.railway.app/api/health` (should return JSON)

## 🎯 Your app is 100% ready for deployment! Choose your method and go live! 🌍
